## Events
- **Rate Limit Alert:** Martin reported Gemini API quota exhaustion yesterday (requests/day > 200 or tokens/min > 100k).
- **New Directive:** Create a backlog dashboard to pace work and avoid hitting limits.
- **Action:** Created `BACKLOG.md` to track tasks and manage throughput.
- **Action:** Acknowledged "commentary" question from earlier (need to clarify context as memory search yielded nothing).
- **Clarification:** Martin defined "commentary" as the `instagram-engagement-hourly` cron task.
- **Verification:** Checked `cron list`; task exists, is enabled, and runs every ~65 mins. Next run imminent.
