## Events
- **Rate Limit Alert:** Martin reported Gemini API quota exhaustion yesterday (requests/day > 200 or tokens/min > 100k).
- **New Directive:** Create a backlog dashboard to pace work and avoid hitting limits.
- **Action:** Created `BACKLOG.md` to track tasks and manage throughput.
- **Action:** Acknowledged "commentary" question from earlier (need to clarify context as memory search yielded nothing).
- **Clarification:** Martin defined "commentary" as the `instagram-engagement-hourly` cron task.
- **Verification:** Checked `cron list`; task exists, is enabled, and runs every ~65 mins. Next run imminent.
- **Instagram Strategy:** Refined via ManusAI. Created `marketing/engagement-instructions.md` with specific hashtags (#jobsearch, #career) and non-spammy comment templates.
- **Action:** Subagent attempted to update cron job directly but lacked `cron` tool access. Strategy file is ready for the main agent to hook up.
