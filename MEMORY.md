## Operational Constraints (CRITICAL)
- **Rate Limits (Gemini):**
    - Max Requests/Day: < 200
    - Max Input Tokens/Min: < 100,000
- **Strategy:** Space out work. Prioritize stability over speed. Take longer to answer if needed to avoid limits.
- **User Pattern:** Learn Martin's high-request times (likely EU mornings/workdays) and conserve quota for those windows.
