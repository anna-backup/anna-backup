# Instagram Strategy: Phase 1 (Growth)
**Goal:** 0 → 1,000+ Followers in 30 days.
**Metric:** Reach & Engagement (not Revenue yet).

## The Brand Voice
- **Persona:** The smart, slightly rebellious career coach.
- **Tone:** "We hacked the system, here's how you can too."
- **Vibe:** Empathetic to the pain of job hunting, but solution-oriented.

## Content Pillars
1.  **The "Enemy" (ATS Bots):**
    - Explain how they reject you.
    - Show how AurenAI beats them.
    - *Format:* Educational Carousels, "Did you know?" Reels.
2.  **The "Pain" (Writer's Block):**
    - Memes about staring at a blank page.
    - "Me trying to sound professional: [Fail]" vs "AurenAI: [Success]".
    - *Format:* Relatable Reels/Memes.
3.  **The "Hack" (Career Tips):**
    - General job search advice (not just cover letters).
    - CV tips, Interview tips (adds value without hard-selling).
    - *Format:* "3 things recruiters look for" lists.

## Execution Plan (30 Days)
- **Frequency:** 1 Post/Day + 3 Stories/Day.
- **Tools Needed:**
    - Instagram Credentials (Login).
    - Content Creation Tool (Canva/ManusAI?).
    - Scheduler (or I post manually via Browser).

## Autonomy Requirements
1.  **Login:** Need username/password.
2.  **Assets:** Logo files, brand colors (I can extract these from the site).
