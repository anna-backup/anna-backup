# Instagram Engagement Instructions (AurenAI)

## 1. Targeting Strategy
**Primary Hashtags (Search & Engage):**
- #jobsearch
- #jobs
- #hiring
- #career
- #jobseekers
- #resume
- #coverletter

**Target Posts:**
- Recent posts (Top Recent) from real users (avoid company ads).
- Users expressing frustration with job hunting, writing cover letters, or applying.

## 2. Engagement Rules (The Anti-Spam Policy)
- **DO NOT** sell directly ("Use AurenAI!").
- **DO NOT** use generic comments ("Nice post!").
- **DO** validate their struggle.
- **DO** offer a small tip.
- **DO** be empathetic.
- **DO** focus on building a relationship, not a transaction.

## 3. Comment Strategy: Uniqueness & Authenticity
- **CRITICAL:** DO NOT reuse the same opening phrase (e.g., "The job hunt is a full-time job"). 
- **RULE:** Every comment must be custom-written based on the specific post content.
- **Tactic:** Start with a specific reference to what the user wrote.
- **Example Hooks (Mix these up!):**
  - "I completely agree with your point about [Specific Detail]..."
  - "That's a really interesting perspective on [Topic]. I usually see people [Opposite Detail]..."
  - "The part where you mentioned [Detail] really hits home."
  - "Adding to your advice, have you considered [Related Tip]?"

## 4. Brand Voice
- Helpful, slightly rebellious against the broken hiring system, empathetic.
